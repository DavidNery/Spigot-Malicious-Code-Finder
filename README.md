Do you have more ideas of malicious code? Send me a dm on Discord **(Dery#2395)**!

I would also like to thank LeonardoSNT for his incredible [project](https://github.com/leonardosnt/java-class-tools) that allows to manipulate JVM bytecode directly in the browser and for his other [project](https://github.com/leonardosnt/jar-string-editor) that allows to change Strings in jar files (this served as my basis)
